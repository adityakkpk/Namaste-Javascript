* 'this' in global space
========================

- In global space 'this' is equal to 'window' object.
- 'this' keyword in global space represent the globalOblect. The globalObject is 'window' in Browser. But in Node.js globalObject is 'global'.



* 'this' iside a function
=========================

- The value of 'this' in function is 'undefined' but javascript has something known as 'this substitution' so the value becomes globalObject if you will not use strict mode.
- 'this' behaves differently in strict mode and normal mode.
- If you are in a function the value of 'this' is depends upon the strict / non strict mode. 
- This value of this in strict mode will be 'undefined' but in non strict mode it will be 'window'. 



* 'this' inside non-strict mode - (this substitution)
=====================================================

- The value of 'this' is undefined or null, 'this' will be replaced with globalObject. This phenomena is known as 'this substitution'.



* 'this' value depends on how the function is called (window)
=============================================================

- If the function is called without a reference, then the value is undefinded.
- If you call the function with a objet reference, this it will be the calling object (window).
- Example: (strict mode)
    x();//undefined
    window.x();// Window



* 'this' inside object's method
===============================

- When you are inside a method, the value of 'this' will be that object in which the method is present.




* call apply bind methods (sharing methods)
===========================================

- 'this' can be modified by using call apply bind methods.
- These methods are used when you have to share methods.
- When we want to share a method of one object ot another object, we override the values of 'this' keyword.




* 'this' inside arrow function
==============================

- Arrow functions does not have their own this.
- They take the value of their lexical environment in which ther are enclosed.

* 'this' inside DOM
===================

- The value of 'this' inside DOM is that HTML element.
