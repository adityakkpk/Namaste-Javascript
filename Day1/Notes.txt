Core Fundamentals
=================

1. "Everything in Javascript happens inside an Execution Context"
2. "Javascript is a synchronous single-threaded language"





** Execution Context **
  =================

    - "Everything in Javascript happens inside an Execution Context"
    - You can asume it as a big container in which whole Javascrip code is executed.
    - It has two components in it.

        a) Memory component
        b) Code component

a) Memory component
   ----------------
    * All the variables and functions are stored as key-value pairs.
    * It is also known as "Variable Environment".

b) Code component
   --------------
    * This is the place where code is executed one line at a time.
    * It is also known as the "Thread of Exeecution".






** Single Threaded **
   ===============

    - It means javascript can only execute one command at a time.  

** Synchronous Single-Threaded **
   ===========================

   - It means javascript can only execute one command at a time in a specific manner.
   - It can only go to the next line once the current line finished executing.
